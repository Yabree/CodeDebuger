CodeDebuger
===========

CodeDebuging tool. Build as easy to be extended ( depends on events ). 
Use for automatic rewrite the page data source urls, javascript files, template files etc. 
Prepares the online project easly to be debug on the localhost
Data is copied from the real url and emulated on the localhost. ( IIS needs to be set up do handle this project ).

Please find my own Chrome plugin to support prepering the debug project.
